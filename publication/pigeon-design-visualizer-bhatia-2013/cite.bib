 abstract = {Pigeon is a Web-based tool that translates a textual description of a synthetic biology design into an image. It allows programmatic generation of design visualizations, is easy to learn, is easily extensible to new glyphs and notation, and can be connected to other software tools for visualizing their output. We present the Pigeon syntax, its current command set, and some examples of Pigeon programs and their output.},

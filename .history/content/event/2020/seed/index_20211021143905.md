title: SEED 2020 Software for Synthetic Biology Workflows Workshop

event: SBOL Workshop
event_url: http://synbioconference.org/2020

location: Hyatt Regency San Francisco
address:
  street: 5 Embarcadero Ctr
  city: San Francisco
  region: CA
  postcode: '94111'
  country: United States

summary: SEED 2020 will focus on advances in science, technology, applications, and related investments in the field of synthetic biology. 
abstract: "This workshop is a tutorial session intended to introduce participants to recent software tools and how they can be used to address common challenges in synthetic biology. The first half of the workshop will introduce a number of recent software tools and key underlying technologies, then show how these can be combined and incorporated into effective organism engineering workflows. In the second half, participants will work hands-on with the tools in groups, with the instructors assisting them in applying tools hands-on to address prototypical example problems and/or challenges from their own work. For the second half, participants are strongly encouraged to bring a laptop with network access.  
  
This workshop will be free for attendees of SEED 2020. There will be a small fee if you wish to attend this workshop without attending SEED."

**The 2020 SEED Conference is Canceled**
Due to the ongoing, and dynamic, situation relating to the Coronavirus (COVID-19) we have made the difficult decision to cancel the 2020 Synthetic Biology: Engineering, Evolution & Design Conference (SEED) in the best interests of attendees, sponsors, and exhibitors. The event will not be rescheduled and refunds will be issued to all registered attendees.

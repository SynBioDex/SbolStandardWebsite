## SBOL

<details>
  <summary><b>What is Synthetic Biology?</b></summary>
  Synthetic biology is a new frontier in biological research where scientists and engineers design and create living systems to carry out useful tasks. In the last half century, the fundamental biochemical pieces and processes that comprise the phenomena of life have been isolated and studied by scientists in the laboratory. This <b>reductionist</b> approach to molecular biology has yielded enormous insight into the basic molecular units that govern life, such as genes encoded on DNA. Today, a new approach, <b>synthetic biology</b>, is possible in which basic units of biochemistry are re-assembled into new living systems, using platform technologies such as DNA synthesis, genome engineering, simulation tools, and computer-aided-design. In the future, important technologies like solar energy, biofuels, and medicines may be synthesized out of "wetware".

<details>
  <summary><b>What is the role of a standard language in synthetic biology?</b></summary>
  Standards decrease friction in markets by reducing the cost of translating data and designs. So commercial entities can concentrate on transacting the goods and services in which they create the most value.
</details>


<details>
  <summary><b>What is SBOL?</b></summary>
  The design process is fundamental to synthetic biology. The SBOL standard empowers and enables a design-oriented, forward-engineering approach for synthetic biology in the following ways:

- Facilitates storage of genetic designs in repositories
- Helps synthetic biologists and genetic engineers electronically exchange designs with each other and with biofabrication centers
- Supports development of Genetic Design Automation (GDA) software tools for synthetic biologists
- Represents hierarchically assembled genetic compositions
- Represents abstract genetic compositions without an explicit nucleotide sequence
- Allows expression of genetic designs in publications and thus aids scientific reproducibility
- Captures elements of a design that move beyond DNA Sequences to include RNA, proteins, small molecules and molecular interactions
- SBOL is extensible to allow other kinds of data to be attached to the core data model. This includes, for example, experimental data, host information and mathematical models
- Introductory slides on SBOL can be found {{% staticref "docs/WhatIsSBOL.pdf" "newtab" %}}here{{% /staticref %}}.

<details>
  <summary><b>What kinds of companies should use SBOL?</b></summary>
  SynBio software companies, DNA synthesis companies, DNA design companies, really any company that makes or uses genetic materials.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>I'm a small company. Why should I use the SBOL standard?</b></summary>
  Use of the SBOL standard promotes ease of data access across applications and devices. Which means faster development time with fewer resources required, so you can get to market quickly.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>I'm a large company. Why should I use SBOL?</b></summary>
  There are no royalties to pay, and you won't be sued for using it. Contributes to efficient patent searching. Patented devices can be represented in SBOL, so you can more easily search for comparison to your proposed designs. Use of open standards is also a key element of corporate social responsibility.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Why not just store all my sequence data in Word and Excel?</b></summary>
  Designs in these tools become ambiguous to other people and are not easily read by, and swapped between software applications.
</details>

  <summary><b>SBOL vs. GenBank</b></summary>
  With the emergence of large-scale DNA sequencing technology in the last few decades, there has also emerged a need to manage and share vast amounts of sequence data. For researchers in the biological sciences, the public GenBank database, data standard, and file format has become a familiar friend. However, there are several reasons why the GenBank standard is insufficient for satisfying the needs of synthetic biologists. While the GenBank standard is used to primarily describe sequences that correspond to an existing DNA sample, the SBOL standard promotes forward-engineering of novel sequences. In other words, SBOL makes it easy to assemble novel sequences from DNA components using computer-aided design and genetic design automation. Moreover, SBOL is able to capture elements of intended design about proteins and small molecules for example, as well as the interactions between them.

  Genbank is a great file format for sequences and unstructured annotations. What can you do with SBOL that you can't with Genbank? Genbank isn't meant for designs. It will not represent interactions between components, let you specify undefined components, is not modular and won't describe designs using proteins and small molecules.

This workshop is conducted as a part of SEED 2019. It is a tutorial session intended to introduce participants to recent software tools and how they can be used to address common challenges in synthetic biology. 

  * The first half of the workshop will introduce a number of recent software tools and key underlying technologies, then show how these can be combined and incorporated into effective organism engineering workflows. 
  * In the second half, participants will work hands-on with the tools in groups, with the instructors assisting them in applying tools hands-on to address prototypical example problems and/or challenges from their own work. 
  * For the second half, participants are strongly encouraged to bring a laptop with network access.

Coming up on August 19th, at the International Workshop on Bio-Design Automation, at the University of Washington campus, Kane Hall 210, in Seattle, WA! If you are a synthetic biologist and not very familiar with the efforts of the SBOL Developers group, this is a great opportunity to learn more about it. The outreach session will include a demo of software tools enabled by SBOL and guided breakout discussions in which we imagine the future of synthetic biology.  
If you are already a member of the SBOL Developers group, whether new or veteran, this is a great opportunity to catch up on the latest news and discuss the future of the community.

The schedule is below:  
13:30 &#8211; 14:00 Introduction to SBOL  
14:00 &#8211; 15:00 Live demos of SBOL-based tools  
15:00 &#8211; 15:30 Coffee Break  
15:30 &#8211; 17:00 Input from the Bench

Sincerely,  
The SBOL Chair & Editors

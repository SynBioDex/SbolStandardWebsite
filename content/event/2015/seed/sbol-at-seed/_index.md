The latest developments in SBOL were presented to the synthetic biology community at [the 2015 Synthetic Biology: Engineering, Evolution & Design (SEED) conference](http://synbioconference.org/2015 "SEED"). There was a lot of interest, and as a result we have new members subscribed to [the SBOL-dev emailing list](http://sbolstandard.org/contact/ "SBOL-dev").

On behalf of the SBOL community, Jake Beal gave a talk titled &#8220;Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL): Community-Driven Standard for Communication of Synthetic Biology Designs&#8221;. He announced the community adopted, alpha version of [the SBOL 2.0 draft specification](http://sbolstandard.org/downloads/draft-specification-2-0/ "SBOL2 Draft").

A poster for SBOL Visual was also presented at the conference.

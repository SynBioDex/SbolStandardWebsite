# SBOL is an open standard for the representation of in silico biological designs.
# SBOL provides a data format composed of genetic vocabulary terms called SBOL Data.
# SBOL also provides schematic glyphs to graphically depict genetic designs called SBOL Visual.
# SBOL standardises data used by synthetic biology practitioners, from users to software developers to wet lab biologists.

Welcome to the <b>Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL)</b> community portal! 

SBOL is a free and open-source standard for the representation of biological designs. The SBOL standard was developed by the synthetic biology community to create a standardized format for the electronic exchange of information on the structural and functional aspects of biological designs.

SBOL was designed for everyone in synthetic biology!

{{< icon name="info-circle" pack="fas" >}} If you are new to SBOL and would like to learn more, checkout the [SBOL section](#sbol)!

{{< icon name="dna" pack="fas" >}} If you would like to use SBOL to create diagrams to visualize your biological designs, you can learn more from the [SBOL Visual section](#visual).

{{< icon name="laptop" pack="fas" >}} If you are a developer, check out all the [libraries](#libraries) created by the SBOL community!

{{< icon name="flask" pack="fas" >}} If you would like to use SBOL without writing any code, you may be interested in the tools and [applications](#applications) developed by the SBOL community!

{{< icon name="file" pack="fas" >}} You can find the latest [SBOL and SBOL visual specifications here](#specifications). We've also included an [exhaustive list of publications](/publication/) that either use SBOL or support SBOL.

{{< icon name="industry" pack="fas" >}} SBOL is also used in the industry! If you are working in the industry and would like learn about how SBOL could support your applications you can join the [SBOL Industrial Consortium](/sbol-industrial/)!

A diagram language and collection of symbols that can be used to
graphically depict a genetic design and its functional
interactions. SBOL Visual 2.0 builds on the prior SBOL Visual 1.0
standard by expanding diagram syntax to include functional
interactions and molecular species, making the relationship between
diagrams and the SBOL data model explicit, supporting families of
symbol variants, clarifying a number of requirements and best
practices, and significantly expanding the collection of diagram
glyphs.

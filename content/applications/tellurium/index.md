Tellurium is a Python environment based on spyder2 IDE, designed for systems and synthetic biology simulations. It combines a number of existing libraries, including libRoadRunner, libAntimony, and phraSED-ML, alongside with standards support through libSBML, libSEDML, and pySBOL. Additionally, other Python packages such as matplotlib and NumPy are used to provide extra analysis, optimization, and plotting capabilities.

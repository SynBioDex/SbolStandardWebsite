The SBOL Industrial Consortium is a pre-competitive non-profit organization supporting innovation, dissemination, and integration of SBOL standards, tools and practices for practical applications in an industrial environment. As the SBOL Industrial Consortium operates pre-competitively, all products of activities supported by the SBOL Industrial Consortium are free, open, and intended to support the core values of the SBOL community.

Specifically, the consortium supports the charitable, educational, and scientific purposes of developing, providing, and promoting education, research, training, and advancement of state-of-the-art technology in the fields of synthetic biology and bio-design automation through SBOL standards and associated tool development. The SBOL Industrial Consortium also provides financial support for projects, activities, and infrastructure within the SBOL community.

The SBOL Industrial Consortium meets regularly to coordinate its activities, as well as organizing an Industrial Advisory Board to provide an industrial perspective on SBOL.

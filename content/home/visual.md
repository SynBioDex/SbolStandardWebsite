SBOL Visual aims to organize and systematize such conventions in order to produce a coherent language for expressing the structure and function of genetic designs. At the same time, we aim to make this language simple and easy to use, allowing a high degree of flexibility and freedom in how such diagrams are organized, presented, and styledâ€”in particular, it should be readily possible to create diagrams both by hand and with a wide variety of software programs.

Read the [SBOL Visual](/visual-about/) page to learn more about the SBOL visual glyphs and how you can create beatutiful diagrams to communicate the structure of nucleic acid sequences that you may be engineering or to show the functional relationships between sequence features and other molecular species!

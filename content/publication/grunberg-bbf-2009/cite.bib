 abstract = {This Request for Comments (RFC) suggests a framework for the description,
exchange and interlinking of Synthetic Biology data. The framework would
create an open process for the evolution and “rolling” standardization of data
models. It describes how data and data models are to be published, how they
are exchanged and integrated between diﬀerent parties, and how they can be
extended, corrected and interlinked in a decentralized fashion. These goals
are achieved by embracing the RDF (Resource Description Framework), a set
of W3C standards. A one-sentence summary of this proposal would there-
fore be: “Use RDF according to the W3C standards.” The PoBoL pro ject
(Provisional BioBrick Ontology Language, https://web.archive.org/web/20091216100340/http://pobol.org/) is based on
this idea.
This RFC does not describe a data model per se but only outlines a
possible architecture and rules of data exchange.},

abstract: 'This Request for Comments (RFC) suggests a framework for the description,   exchange
  and interlinking of Synthetic Biology data. The framework would   create an open
  process for the evolution and “rolling” standardization of data   models. It describes
  how data and data models are to be published, how they   are exchanged and integrated
  between diﬀerent parties, and how they can be   extended, corrected and interlinked
  in a decentralized fashion. These goals   are achieved by embracing the RDF (Resource
  Description Framework), a set   of W3C standards. A one-sentence summary of this
  proposal would there-   fore be: “Use RDF according to the W3C standards.” The PoBoL
  pro ject   (Provisional BioBrick Ontology Language, https://web.archive.org/web/20091216100340/http://pobol.org/) is based on   this
  idea.   This RFC does not describe a data model per se but only outlines a   possible
  architecture and rules of data exchange.'

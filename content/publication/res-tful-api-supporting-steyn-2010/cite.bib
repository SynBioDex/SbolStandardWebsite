 abstract = {Constructing simulatable models for BioBricks by hand is a complex and time-consuming task. The time taken could be reduced by using Computer Aided Design (CAD) tools to aid in designing models, but these tools need to be augmented with domain-specific knowledge. Here we propose a standard for a RESTful (Richardson, 2007) API which facilitates the discovery and publication of models of functional biological units. This API is designed to produce parts models which can be automatically combined into complete, simulatable models of entire systems.},

abstract: The Synthetic Biology Open Language version 3 (SBOL3) provides a data model for representation of synthetic biology information across multiple scales and throughout the design-build-test-learn workflow. To support practical use of this data model, we have developed pySBOL3, a Python library that allows programmers to create and edit SBOL3 documents. Here we describe this library and key engineering decisions in its design. The resulting implementation is a compact and maintainable core that provides both a familiar, pythonic interface for manipulating SBOL3 objects as well as mechanisms for building additional extensions and representations on this base.

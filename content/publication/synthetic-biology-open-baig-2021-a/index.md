abstract: "People who engineer biological organisms often find it useful to draw diagrams\
  \ in order to communicate both the structure of the nucleic acid sequences that\
  \ they are engineering and the functional relationships between sequence features\
  \ and other molecular species. Some typical practices and conventions have begun\
  \ to emerge for such diagrams. SBOL Visual aims to organize and systematize such\
  \ conventions in order to produce a coherent language for expressing the structure\
  \ and function of genetic designs. This document details version 3.0 of SBOL Visual,\
  \ a new major revision of the standard. The major difference between SBOL Visual\
  \ 3 and SBOL Visual 2 is that diagrams and glyphs are defined with respect to the\
  \ SBOL 3 data model rather than the SBOL 2 data model. A byproduct of this change\
  \ is that the use of dashed undirected lines for subsystem mappings has been removed,\
  \ pending future determination on how to represent general SBOL 3 constraints; in\
  \ the interim, this annotation can still be used as an annotation. Finally, deprecated\
  \ material has been removed from collection of glyphs: the deprecated ``insulator''\
  \ glyph and ``macromolecule'' alternative glyphs have been removed, as have the\
  \ deprecated BioPAX alternatives to SBO terms."

 abstract = {The Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL) is an emerging synthetic biology data exchange standard, designed primarily for unambiguous and efficient machine-to-machine communication. However, manual editing of SBOL is generally difficult for nontrivial designs. Here, we describe ShortBOL, a lightweight SBOL scripting language that bridges the gap between manual editing, visual design tools, and direct programming. ShortBOL is a shorthand textual language developed to enable users to create SBOL designs quickly and easily, without requiring strong programming skills or visual design tools.},

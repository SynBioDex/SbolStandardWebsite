 abstract = {Synthetic Biology Open Language Visual (SBOLv) is a graphical notation that supports   biological device development. It provides a formal notation for describing the physical   composition of basic parts into composite parts during the development of biological devices. It   is targeted for use by biological engineers in forward engineering projects. It encourages and   supports model-driven engineering.},

abstract: "Synthetic biology brings together concepts and techniques from engineering and biology. In this field, computer-aided design (CAD) is necessary in order to bridge the gap between computational modeling and biological data. Using a CAD application, it would be possible to construct models using available biological \"parts\" and directly generate the DNA sequence that represents the model, thus increasing the efficiency of design and construction of synthetic networks."

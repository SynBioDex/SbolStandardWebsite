abstract: "SynBioHub is a repository for synthetic genetic designs represented in the Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL). To integrate SynBioHub into more synthetic biology workflows, its data processing capabilities need to be expanded. To this end, a plugin interface has been developed. Plugins can be developed for data submission, visualization, and download. This framework was tested by the development of three example plugins, one of each type as follows: one allowing the submission of SnapGene files, one visualizing the course of different genetic parts, and one preparing plasmid maps for download."

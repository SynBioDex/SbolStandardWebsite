abstract: "Background Synthetic biological systems are currently created by an ad-hoc,\
  \ iterative process of specification, design, and assembly. These systems would\
  \ greatly benefit from a more formalized and rigorous specification of the desired\
  \ system components as well as constraints on their composition. Therefore, the\
  \ creation of robust and efficient design flows and tools is imperative. We present\
  \ a human readable language (Eugene) that allows for the specification of synthetic\
  \ biological designs based on biological parts, as well as provides a very expressive\
  \ constraint system to drive the automatic creation of composite Parts (Devices)\
  \ from a collection of individual Parts. Results We illustrate Eugene's capabilities\
  \ in three different areas: Device specification, design space exploration, and\
  \ assembly and simulation integration. These results highlight Eugene's ability\
  \ to create combinatorial design spaces and prune these spaces for simulation or\
  \ physical assembly. Eugene creates functional designs quickly and cost-effectively.\
  \ Conclusions Eugene is intended for forward engineering of DNA-based devices, and\
  \ through its data types and execution semantics, reflects the desired abstraction\
  \ hierarchy in synthetic biology. Eugene provides a powerful constraint system which\
  \ can be used to drive the creation of new devices at runtime. It accomplishes all\
  \ of this while being part of a larger tool chain which includes support for design,\
  \ simulation, and physical device assembly."

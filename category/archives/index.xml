If you are a synthetic biologist and not very familiar with the efforts of the SBOL Developers group, this is a great opportunity to learn more about it. The outreach session will include a demo of software tools enabled by SBOL and guided breakout discussions in which we imagine the future of synthetic biology.&lt;br>
If you are already a member of the SBOL Developers group, whether new or veteran, this is a great opportunity to catch up on the latest news and discuss the future of the community.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The schedule is below:&lt;br>
13:30 – 14:00 Introduction to SBOL&lt;br>
14:00 – 15:00 Live demos of SBOL-based tools&lt;br>
15:00 – 15:30 Coffee Break&lt;br>

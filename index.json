This paper describes a workflow for automatic generation of computational models of genetic circuits from data stored in design repositories using existing standards. This workflow leverages the software tool SBOLDesigner to build structural models that are then enriched by the Virtual Parts Repository API using Systems Biology Open Language (SBOL) data fetched from the SynBioHub design repository. The iBioSim software tool is then utilized to convert this SBOL description into a computational model encoded using the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML).

The Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL) has already emerged as a data standard to represent information about genetic circuits, and it is based on capturing data using graphs. The language provides the syntax using a free text document that is accessible to humans only. This paper describes SBOL-OWL, an ontology for a machine understandable definition of SBOL. This ontology acts as a semantic layer for genetic circuit designs. As a result, computational tools can understand the meaning of design entities in addition to parsing structured SBOL data. SBOL-OWL not only describes how genetic circuits can be constructed computationally, it also facilitates the use of several existing Semantic Web tools for synthetic biology. This paper demonstrates some of these features, for example, to validate designs and check for inconsistencies. Through the use of SBOL-OWL, queries can be simplified and become more intuitive. Moreover, existing reasoners can be used to infer information about genetic circuit designs that cannot be directly retrieved using existing querying mechanisms. This ontological representation of the SBOL standard provides a new perspective to the verification, representation, and querying of information about genetic circuits and is important to incorporate complex design information via the integration of biological ontologies.","tags":[],"title":"SBOL-OWL: An Ontological Approach for Formal and Semantic Representation of Synthetic Biology Information","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nicholas Roehner","Bryan Bartley","Jacob Beal","James McLaughlin","Matthew Pocock","Michael Zhang","Zach Zundel","Chris J.

The field still faces substantial challenges, including long development times, high rates of failure, and poor reproducibility. One method to ameliorate these problems is to improve the exchange of information about designed systems between laboratories. The synthetic biology open language (SBOL) has been developed as a standard to support the specification and exchange of biological design information in synthetic biology, filling a need not satisfied by other pre-existing standards. This document details version 2.3.0 of SBOL, which builds upon version 2.2.0 published in last year’s JIB Standards in Systems Biology special issue. In particular, SBOL 2.3.0 includes means of succinctly representing sequence modifications, such as insertion, deletion, and replacement, an extension to support organization and attachment of experimental data derived from designs, and an extension for describing numerical parameters of design elements. The new version also includes specifying types of synthetic biology activities, unambiguous locations for sequences with multiple encodings, refinement of a number of validation rules, improved figures and examples, and clarification on a number of issues related to the use of external ontology terms.textless/ptextgreatertextless/sectiontextgreater","tags":[],"title":"Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL) Version 2.3","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Curtis Madsen","Angel Goni Moreno","Zachary Palchick","Umesh P","Nicholas Roehner","Bryan Bartley","Swapnil Bhatia","Shyam Bhakta","Mike Bissell","Kevin Clancy","Robert Sidney Cox","Thomas Gorochowski","Raik Grunberg","Augustin Luna","James McLaughlin","Tramy Nguyen","Nicolas Le Novere","Matthew Pocock","Herbert Sauro","James Scott-Brown","John T.

Protein Language consists of glyphs for representing important features (e.g., globular domains, recognition and localization sequences, sites of covalent modification, cleavage and catalysis), rules for composing these glyphs to represent complex architectures, and rules constraining the scaling and styling of diagrams. To support Protein Language we have implemented an extensible web-based software diagram tool, Protein Designer, that uses Protein Language in a “drag and drop” interface for visualization and computer-aided-design of engineered proteins, as well as conversion of annotated protein sequences to Protein Language diagrams and figure export.

This approach is currently hampered by a lack of well-defined and characterized parts and devices. However, there is a wealth of existing biological information, which can be used to identify and characterize biological parts, and their design constraints in the literature and numerous biological databases. However, this information is spread among these databases in many different formats. New computational approaches are required to make this information available in an integrated format that is more amenable to data mining. A tried and tested approach to this problem is to map disparate data sources into a single data set, with common syntax and semantics, to produce a data warehouse or knowledge base. Ontologies have been used extensively in the life sciences, providing this common syntax and semantics as a model for a given biological domain, in a fashion that is amenable to computational analysis and reasoning. Here, we present an ontology for applications in synthetic biology design, SyBiOnt, which facilitates the modeling of information about biological parts and their relationships. SyBiOnt was used to create the SyBiOntKB knowledge base, incorporating and building upon existing life sciences ontologies and standards. The reasoning capabilities of ontologies were then applied to automate the mining of biological parts from this knowledge base. We propose that this approach will be useful to speed up synthetic biology design and ultimately help facilitate the automation of the biological engineering life cycle.","tags":[],"title":"Data Integration and Mining for Synthetic Biology Design","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jacob Beal","Robert Sidney Cox","Raik Grünberg","James McLaughlin","Tramy Nguyen","Bryan Bartley","Michael Bissell","Kiri Choi","Kevin Clancy","Chris Macklin","Curtis Madsen","Goksel Misirli","Ernst Oberortner","Matthew Pocock","Nicholas Roehner","Meher Samineni","Michael Zhang","Zhen Zhang","Zach Zundel","John H.

The goals of this standard are to allow scientists to exchange designs of biological parts and systems, to facilitate the storage of genetic designs in repositories, and to facilitate the description of genetic designs in publications. In order to achieve these goals, the development of an infrastructure to store, retrieve, and exchange SBOL data is necessary. To address this problem, we have developed the SBOL Stack, a Resource Description Framework (RDF) database specifically designed for the storage, integration, and publication of SBOL data. This database allows users to define a library of synthetic parts and designs as a service, to share SBOL data with collaborators, and to store designs of biological systems locally. The database also allows external data sources to be integrated by mapping them to the SBOL data model. The SBOL Stack includes two Web interfaces: the SBOL Stack API and SynBioHub. While the former is designed for developers, the latter allows users to upload new SBOL biological designs, download SBOL documents, search by keyword, and visualize SBOL data. Since the SBOL Stack is based on semantic Web technology, the inherent distributed querying functionality of RDF databases can be used to allow different SBOL stack databases to be queried simultaneously, and therefore, data can be shared between different institutes, centers, or other users.","tags":[],"title":"The SBOL Stack: A Platform for Storing, Publishing, and Sharing Synthetic Biology Designs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jacqueline Y.

To support automated, model-driven design it is desirable that in silico models are modular, composable and use standard formats. The synthetic biology design process typically involves the composition of genetic circuits from individual parts. At the most basic level, these parts are representations of genetic features such as promoters, ribosome binding sites (RBSs), and coding sequences (CDSs). However, it is also desirable to model the biological molecules and behaviour that arise when these parts are combined in vivo. Modular models of parts can be composed and their associated systems simulated, facilitating the process of model-centred design. The availability of databases of modular models is essential to support software tools used in the model-driven design process. In this article, we present an approach to support the development of composable, modular models for synthetic biology, termed Standard Virtual Parts. We then describe a programmatically accessible and publicly available database of these models to allow their use by computational design tools.","tags":["\"composable models\"","\"database of models\"","\"model annotation\"","\"model-driven design\"","\"standard virtual parts\"","\"Synthetic biology\""],"title":"Composable Modular Models for Synthetic Biology","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhen Zhang","Tramy Nguyen","Nicholas Roehner","Göksel Misirli","Matthew Pocock","Ernst Oberortner","Meher Samineni","Zach Zundel","Jacob Beal","Kevin Clancy","Anil Wipat","Chris J.

The design of biologically engineered systems is however nontrivial, requiring contributions from a wide array of disciplines. One particular issue that confronts synthetic biologists is the ability to unambiguously describe novel designs such that they can be reengineered by a third-party. For this reason, the synthetic biology open language (SBOL) was developed as a community wide standard for formally representing biological designs. A design created by one engineering team can be transmitted electronically to another who can then use this design to reproduce the experimental results. The development and the community of the SBOL standard started in 2008 and has since grown in use with now over 80 participants, including international, academic, and industrial interests. SBOL has stimulated the development of repositories and software tools to help synthetic biologists in their design efforts.

It is among the first genetic technology mapping algorithms to adapt techniques from electronic circuit design, in particular the use of a cost function to guide the search for an optimal solution, and perhaps that which makes the greatest use of standards for describing genetic function and structure to represent design specifications and component libraries. This paper demonstrates the use of our algorithm to map the specifications for three different genetic circuits against four randomly generated libraries of increasing size to evaluate its performance against both exhaustive search and greedy variants for finding optimal and near-optimal solutions.","tags":[],"title":"Directed Acyclic Graph-Based Technology Mapping of Genetic Circuit Models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Evan Appleton","Jenhan Tao","Traci Haddock","Douglas Densmore"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1401580800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600547305,"objectID":"a5a49fce9e58c16bcbb2295eb80a1311","permalink":"/publication/appleton-interactive-2014/","publishdate":"2020-09-19T20:28:25.871307Z","relpermalink":"/publication/appleton-interactive-2014/","section":"publication","summary":"Raven calculates assembly plans for complex genetic constructs from thousands of parts.

The success of these projects, however, has often failed in translation and application to new projects, a problem exacerbated by a lack of engineering standards that combine descriptions of the structure and function of DNA. To address this need, this paper describes a methodology to connect the systems biology markup language (SBML) to the synthetic biology open language (SBOL), existing standards that describe biochemical models and DNA components, respectively. Our methodology involves first annotating SBML model elements such as species and reactions with SBOL DNA components. A graph is then constructed from the model, with vertices corresponding to elements within the model and edges corresponding to the cause-and-effect relationships between these elements. Lastly, the graph is traversed to assemble the annotating DNA components into a composite DNA component, which is used to annotate the model itself and can be referenced by other composite models and DNA components. In this way, our methodology can be used to build up a hierarchical library of models annotated with DNA components. Such a library is a useful input to any future genetic technology mapping algorithm that would automate the process of composing DNA components to satisfy a behavioral specification. Our methodology for SBML-to-SBOL annotation is implemented in the latest version of our genetic design automation (GDA) software tool, iBioSim.","tags":[],"title":"A Methodology to Annotate Systems Biology Markup Language Models with the Synthetic Biology Open Language","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Swapnil Bhatia","Douglas Densmore"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1371772800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600547305,"objectID":"824fc0c501dfaf9a3fca9b0172a2ab6c","permalink":"/publication/bhatia-pigeon-2013/","publishdate":"2020-09-19T20:28:25.434469Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bhatia-pigeon-2013/","section":"publication","summary":"Pigeon is a Web-based tool that translates a textual description of a synthetic biology design into an image.

The workflow is based on a sequence of intermediate models that incrementally translate high-level specifications into DNA samples that implement them. We identify algorithms for translating between adjacent models and implement them as a set of software tools, organized into a four-stage toolchain: Specification, Compilation, Part Assignment, and Assembly. The specification stage begins with a Boolean logic computation specified in the Proto programming language. The compilation stage uses a library of network motifs and cellular platforms, also specified in Proto, to transform the program into an optimized Abstract Genetic Regulatory Network (AGRN) that implements the programmed behavior. The part assignment stage assigns DNA parts to the AGRN, drawing the parts from a database for the target cellular platform, to create a DNA sequence implementing the AGRN. Finally, the assembly stage computes an optimized assembly plan to create the DNA sequence from available part samples, yielding a protocol for producing a sample of engineered plasmids with robotics assistance. Our workflow is the first to automate the production of biological networks from a high-level program specification. Furthermore, the workflow’s modular design allows the same program to be realized on different cellular platforms simply by swapping workflow configurations. We validated our workflow by specifying a small-molecule sensor-reporter program and verifying the resulting plasmids in both HEK 293 mammalian cells and in E. coli bacterial cells.","tags":[],"title":"An End-to-End Workflow for Engineering of Biological Networks from High-Level Specifications","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fusun Yaman","Swapnil Bhatia","Aaron Adler","Douglas Densmore","Jacob Beal"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1345161600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600547304,"objectID":"788ca7e6905405c1ed26bb9d25e2c1ce","permalink":"/publication/yaman-automated-2012/","publishdate":"2020-09-19T20:28:24.78168Z","relpermalink":"/publication/yaman-automated-2012/","section":"publication","summary":"Raising the level of abstraction for synthetic biology design requires solving several challenging problems, including mapping abstract designs to DNA sequences. In this paper we present the first formalism and algorithms to address this problem. The key steps of this transformation are feature matching, signal matching, and part matching. Feature matching ensures that the mapping satisfies the regulatory relationships in the abstract design. Signal matching ensures that the expression levels of functional units are compatible. Finally, part matching finds a DNA part sequence that can implement the design. Our software tool MatchMaker implements these three steps.","tags":[],"title":"Automated Selection of Synthetic Biology Parts for Genetic Regulatory Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Curtis Madsen","Chris J.

It is difficult to genetically manipulate many gene clusters because of complex, redundant, and integrated host regulation. We have developed a systematic approach to completely specify the genetics of a gene cluster by rebuilding it from the bottom up using only synthetic, well-characterized parts. This process removes all native regulation, including that which is undiscovered. First, all noncoding DNA, regulatory proteins, and nonessential genes are removed. The codons of essential genes are changed to create a DNA sequence as divergent as possible from the wild-type (WT) gene. Recoded genes are computationally scanned to eliminate internal regulation. They are organized into operons and placed under the control of synthetic parts (promoters, ribosome binding sites, and terminators) that are functionally separated by spacer parts. Finally, a controller consisting of genetic sensors and circuits regulates the conditions and dynamics of gene expression. We applied this approach to an agriculturally relevant gene cluster from Klebsiella oxytoca encoding the nitrogen fixation pathway for converting atmospheric N2 to ammonia. The native gene cluster consists of 20 genes in seven operons and is encoded in 23.5 kb of DNA. We constructed a “refactored” gene cluster that shares little DNA sequence identity with WT and for which the function of every genetic part is defined. This work demonstrates the potential for synthetic biology tools to rewrite the genetics encoding complex biological functions to facilitate access, engineering, and transferability.","tags":[],"title":"Refactoring the nitrogen fixation gene cluster from Klebsiella oxytoca","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anil Wipat","Alan Villalobos","Guy-Bart Stan","Trevor Smith","Herbert Sauro","Nicholas Roehner","Matthew Pocock","Hector Plahar","Jean Peccoud","Chris Myers","Goksel Misirli","Curtis Madsen","Matthew Lux","Allan Kuchinsky","Timothy Ham","Raik Grünberg","John Gennari","Drew Endy","Omri Drory","Douglas Densmore","Deepak Chandran","Jacob Beal","J.

These systems would greatly benefit from a more formalized and rigorous specification of the desired system components as well as constraints on their composition. Therefore, the creation of robust and efficient design flows and tools is imperative. We present a human readable language (Eugene) that allows for the specification of synthetic biological designs based on biological parts, as well as provides a very expressive constraint system to drive the automatic creation of composite Parts (Devices) from a collection of individual Parts. Results We illustrate Eugene's capabilities in three different areas: Device specification, design space exploration, and assembly and simulation integration. These results highlight Eugene's ability to create combinatorial design spaces and prune these spaces for simulation or physical assembly. Eugene creates functional designs quickly and cost-effectively. Conclusions Eugene is intended for forward engineering of DNA-based devices, and through its data types and execution semantics, reflects the desired abstraction hierarchy in synthetic biology. Eugene provides a powerful constraint system which can be used to drive the creation of new devices at runtime. It accomplishes all of this while being part of a larger tool chain which includes support for design, simulation, and physical device assembly.","tags":["\"Biochemical simulations\"","\"Bioengineering\"","\"Computer software\"","\"Language\"","\"Outer membrane proteins\"","\"Programming languages\"","\"Syntax\"","\"Synthetic biology\""],"title":"Eugene – A Domain Specific Language for Specifying and Constraining Synthetic Biological Parts, Devices, and Systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michal Galdzicki","Cesar Rodriguez","Deepak Chandran","Herbert M.

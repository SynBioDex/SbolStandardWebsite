Sometimes, humans can interpret missing information by making assumptions and drawing inferences from information already provided. Doing so, however, is error-prone and typically requires a high level of interpersonal communication. In this paper, we present a tool that addresses this challenge by providing a simple interface for incremental formal codification of experiment designs. Users interact with a Google Docs word-processing interface with structured tables, backed by assisted linking to machine-readable definitions in a data repository (SynBioHub) and specification of available protocols and requests for execution in the Open Protocol Interface Language (OPIL). The result is an easy-to-use tool for generating machine-readable descriptions of experiment designs with which users in the DARPA SD2 program have collected data from 80 208 samples using a variety of protocols and instruments over the course of 181 experiment runs.","tags":null,"title":"Intent Parser: A Tool for Codification and Sharing of Experimental Design","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Göksel Mısırlı","Bill Yang","Katherine James","Anil Wipat"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1638316800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1638316800,"objectID":"f4c80dbb1a5320f9510be8c3e2112907","permalink":"/publication/virtual-parts-repository-misirli-2021/","publishdate":"2022-01-12T03:23:30.595215Z","relpermalink":"/publication/virtual-parts-repository-misirli-2021/","section":"publication","summary":"Engineering genetic regulatory circuits is key to the creation of biological applications that are responsive to environmental changes. Computational models can assist in understanding especially large and complex circuits for which manual analysis is infeasible, permitting a model-driven design process. However, there are still few tools that offer the ability to simulate the system under design. One of the reasons for this is the lack of accessible model repositories or libraries that cater to the modular composition of models of synthetic systems. Here, we present the second version of the Virtual Parts Repository, a framework to facilitate the model-driven design of genetic regulatory circuits, which provides reusable, modular, and composable models. The new framework is service-oriented, easier to use in computational workflows, and provides several new features and access methods. New features include supporting hierarchical designs via a graph-based repository or compatible remote repositories, enriching existing designs, and using designs provided in Synthetic Biology Open Language documents to derive system-scale and hierarchical Systems Biology Markup Language models. We also present a reaction-based modeling abstraction inspired by rule-based modeling techniques to facilitate scalable and modular modeling of complex and large designs. This modeling abstraction enhances the modeling capability of the framework, for example, to incorporate design patterns such as roadblocking, distributed deployment of genetic circuits using plasmids, and cellular resource dependency. The framework and the modeling abstraction presented in this paper allow computational design tools to take advantage of computational simulations and ultimately help facilitate more predictable applications.","tags":null,"title":"Virtual Parts Repository 2: Model-Driven Design of Genetic Regulatory Circuits","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nicholas Roehner","Jeanet Mante","Chris J.

Most biological designs, however, are still specified at the sequence level. Consequently, there exists a need for a tool that can be used to automatically infer component-based design representations from sequences, particularly in cases when those sequences have minimal levels of annotation. Such a tool would assist computational synthetic biologists in bridging the gap between the outputs of sequence editors and the inputs to more sophisticated design tools, and it would facilitate their development of automated workflows for design curation and quality control. Accordingly, we introduce Synthetic Biology Curation Tools (SYNBICT), a Python tool suite for automation-assisted annotation, curation, and functional inference for genetic designs. We have validated SYNBICT by applying it to genetic designs in the DARPA Synergistic Discovery \u0026 Design (SD2) program and the International Genetically Engineered Machines (iGEM) 2018 distribution. Most notably, SYNBICT is more automated and parallelizable than manual design editors, and it can be applied to interpret existing designs instead of only generating new ones.","tags":null,"title":"Synthetic Biology Curation Tools (SYNBICT)","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Version 3.0.1 is an extension of version 3.0.0 data model to allow flexibility and extendibility of the following: move declaration of SBOL namespace from serialization to identifiers, change all identifiers.org URLs to short form, add serialization recommendation, use best practices in URI examples, change of logos, added compact validation rules, add extension of SBOL classes to extension options, improve complementary standards section, explain closure assumptions and document composition implications, use RDF cardinality terminology, add combinatorial derivation \u0026amp; validation rules amongst other fixes and updates.\nVersion 3.0.1 of SBOL was published on October 27, 2021\n","date":1635292800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1635292800,"objectID":"80a627bf62f545c2392b30dbb673b398","permalink":"/datamodel-specification/version-3.0.1/","publishdate":"2021-10-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/datamodel-specification/version-3.0.1/","section":"DataModel-Specification","summary":"Version 3.0.1 is an extension of version 3.0.0 data model to allow flexibility and extendibility of the following: move declaration of SBOL namespace from serialization to identifiers, change all identifiers.org URLs to short form, add serialization recommendation, use best practices in URI examples, change of logos, added compact validation rules, add extension of SBOL classes to extension options, improve complementary standards section, explain closure assumptions and document composition implications, use RDF cardinality terminology, add combinatorial derivation \u0026amp; validation rules amongst other fixes and updates.","tags":null,"title":"SBOL Data Model Version 3.0.1","type":"DataModel-Specification"},{"authors":["Hector A.

This distributed database allows users from one registry to query and access plasmid, strain, (DNA) part, plant seed, and protein entry types in other connected registries. Users can also transfer entries from one ICE registry to another or make them publicly accessible. Bioparts, the new search portal, combines the ease and convenience of modern web search engines with the capabilities of bioinformatics search tools such as BLAST.

While there are a number of large community repositories of design information, curation of this information has been limited. This in turn limits the ways in which design information can be put to use. The aim of this work was to improve this situation by creating a curated library of parts from the International Genetically Engineered Machines (iGEM) registry data set. To this end, an analysis of the Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL) version of the iGEM registry was carried out using four different approaches-simple statistics, SnapGene autoannotation, SYNBICT autoannotation, and expert analysis-the results of which are presented herein. Key challenges encountered include the use of free text, insufficient part provenance, part duplication, lack of part removal, and insufficient continuous curation. On the basis of these analyses, the focus has shifted from the creation of a curated iGEM part library to instead the extraction of a set of lessons, which are presented here. These lessons can be exploited to facilitate the creation and curation of other part libraries using a simpler and less labor intensive process.","tags":["analysis","annotation","automation","curation","iGEM","SBOL","SYNBICT","SynBioHub"],"title":"Curation Principles Derived from the Analysis of the SBOL iGEM Data Set","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lukas Buecherl","Riley Roberts","Pedro Fontanarrosa","Payton J.

Similar to asynchronous electronic circuits, some combinational genetic circuits may show unwanted switching variations (glitches) caused by multiple input changes. Depending on the biological circuit, glitches can cause irreversible effects and jeopardize the circuit's functionality. This paper presents a stochastic analysis to predict glitch propensities for three implementations of a genetic circuit with known glitching behavior. The analysis uses STochastic Approximate Model-checker for INfinite-state Analysis (STAMINA), a tool for stochastic verification. The STAMINA results were validated by comparison to stochastic simulation in iBioSim resulting in further improvements of STAMINA. This paper demonstrates that stochastic verification can be utilized by genetic designers to evaluate design choices and input restrictions to achieve a desired reliability of operation.","tags":null,"title":"Stochastic Hazard Analysis of Genetic Circuits in iBioSim and STAMINA","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hasan Baig","Pedro Fontanarrosa","James McLaughlin","James Scott-Brown","Prashant Vaidyanathan","Thomas Gorochowski","Goksel Misirli","Jacob Beal","Chris Myers"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1633046400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1635350385,"objectID":"d5037bc3de36c6c37927435802aeddcb","permalink":"/publication/synthetic-biology-open-baig-2021-a/","publishdate":"2021-10-27T15:59:42.228476Z","relpermalink":"/publication/synthetic-biology-open-baig-2021-a/","section":"publication","summary":"People who engineer biological organisms often find it useful to draw diagrams in order to communicate both the structure of the nucleic acid sequences that they are engineering and the functional relationships between sequence features and other molecular species. Some typical practices and conventions have begun to emerge for such diagrams. SBOL Visual aims to organize and systematize such conventions in order to produce a coherent language for expressing the structure and function of genetic designs. This document details version 3.0 of SBOL Visual, a new major revision of the standard. The major difference between SBOL Visual 3 and SBOL Visual 2 is that diagrams and glyphs are defined with respect to the SBOL 3 data model rather than the SBOL 2 data model. A byproduct of this change is that the use of dashed undirected lines for subsystem mappings has been removed, pending future determination on how to represent general SBOL 3 constraints; in the interim, this annotation can still be used as an annotation.

It supports an iterative workflow that begins with specification of the desired synthetic system, followed by simulation and verification of the system in high-performance environments and ending with the eventual compilation of the system specification into suitable genetic constructs. IBW integrates modeling, simulation, verification, and biocompilation features into a single software suite. This integration is achieved through a new domain-specific biological programming language, the Infobiotics Language (IBL), which tightly combines these different aspects of in silico synthetic biology into a full-stack integrated development environment. Unlike existing synthetic biology modeling or specification languages, IBL uniquely blends modeling, verification, and biocompilation statements into a single file. This allows biologists to incorporate design constraints within the specification file rather than using decoupled and independent formalisms for different in silico analyses. This novel approach offers seamless interoperability across different tools as well as compatibility with SBOL and SBML frameworks and removes the burden of doing manual translations for standalone applications. We demonstrate the features, usability, and effectiveness of IBW and IBL using well-established synthetic biological circuits.","tags":null,"title":"Toward Full-Stack In Silico Synthetic Biology: Integrating Model Specification, Simulation, Verification, and Biological Compilation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Benjamin Hatch","Linhao Meng","Jeanet Mante","James A.

Some typical practices and conventions have begun to emerge for such diagrams. The Synthetic Biology Open Language Visual (SBOL Visual) has been developed as a standard for organizing and systematizing such conventions in order to produce a coherent language for expressing the structure and function of genetic designs. This document details version 2.3 of SBOL Visual, which builds on the prior SBOL Visual 2.2 in several ways. First, the specification now includes higher-level ``interactions with interactions,'' such as an inducer molecule stimulating a repression interaction. Second, binding with a nucleic acid backbone can be shown by overlapping glyphs, as with other molecular complexes. Finally, a new ``unspecified interaction'' glyph is added for visualizing interactions whose nature is unknown, the ``insulator'' glyph is deprecated in favor of a new ``inert DNA spacer'' glyph, and the polypeptide region glyph is recommended for showing 2A sequences.","tags":[],"title":"Synthetic Biology Open Language Visual (SBOL Visual) Version 2.3","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The major difference between SBOL Visual 3 and SBOL Visual 2 is that diagrams and glyphs are defined with respect to the SBOL 3 data model rather than the SBOL 2 data model.\nA byproduct of this change is that the use of dashed undirected lines for subsystem mappings has been removed.

Components must be described in such a way as to account for their behavior in a range of contexts. Measurements and associated metadata, including part composition, constitute the test phase of the DBTL cycle. These data may consist of measurements of thousands of circuits, measured in hundreds of conditions, in multiple assays potentially performed in different laboratories and using different techniques. In order to inform the learn phase this large volume of data must be filtered, collated, and analyzed. Characterization consists of using this data to parametrize models of component function in different contexts, and combining them to predict behaviors of novel circuits. Tools to store, organize, share, and analyze large volumes of measurement and metadata are therefore essential to linking the test phase to the build and learn phases, closing the loop of the DBTL cycle. Here we present such a system, implemented as a web app with a backend data registry and analysis engine. An interactive frontend provides powerful querying, plotting, and analysis tools, and we provide a REST API and Python package for full integration with external build and learn software.

For example, circuit diagrams are commonplace in electronics and allow for a suitable abstraction of the physical system that helps support the design process. With the development of the Synthetic Biology Open Language Visual (SBOLv), bioengineers are now positioned to better describe and share their biological designs visually. However, the development of computational tools to support the creation of these diagrams is currently hampered by an excessive burden in maintenance due to the large and expanding number of glyphs present in the standard. Here, we present a Python package called paraSBOLv that enables access to the full suite of SBOLv glyphs through the use of machine-readable parametric glyph definitions. These greatly simplify the rendering process while allowing extensive customization of the resulting diagrams. We demonstrate how the adoption of paraSBOLv can accelerate the development of highly specialized biodesign visualization tools or even form the basis for more complex software by removing the burden of maintaining glyph-specific rendering code. Looking forward, we suggest that incorporation of machine-readable parametric glyph definitions into the SBOLv standard could further simplify the development of tools to produce standard-compliant diagrams and the integration of visual standards across fields.","tags":["genetic design visualization","Python","SBOL visual","synthetic biology"],"title":"paraSBOLv: A Foundation for Standard-Compliant Genetic Design Visualization Tools","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"SBOL Visual 2.3 provides a simple and flexible language for diagrams of genetic systems and design, including both structure (e.g., nucleic acid sequence features) and function (e.g., regulatory interactions and reactions).\nSBOL Visual 2.3 enhances the prior SBOL Visual 2.2 standard as follows:\n Adds higher-level \u0026ldquo;interactions with interactions\u0026rdquo;, such as an inducer molecule stimulating a repression interaction Binding with a nucleic acid backbone can be shown by overlapping glyphs, as with other molecular complexes Recommends using polypeptide region glyph to show 2A sequences Adds new \u0026ldquo;unspecified interaction\u0026rdquo; glyph for visualizing interactions whose nature is unknown Deprecates \u0026ldquo;insulator\u0026rdquo; glyph in favor of new \u0026ldquo;inert DNA spacer\u0026rdquo; glyph  ","date":1607040000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1607040000,"objectID":"706e7b40126691e91f6751b71f1c4c66","permalink":"/visual-specification/version-2.3.0/","publishdate":"2020-12-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/visual-specification/version-2.3.0/","section":"visual-specification","summary":"SBOL Visual 2.3 provides a simple and flexible language for diagrams of genetic systems and design, including both structure (e.g., nucleic acid sequence features) and function (e.g., regulatory interactions and reactions).","tags":null,"title":"SBOL Visual Version 2.3.0","type":"visual-specification"},{"authors":["Bradley Brown","Bryan Bartley","Jacob Beal","Jasmine E.

It is important that these systems can be represented and shared in a standard way to ensure they can be easily understood, reproduced, and utilized by other researchers. The Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL) is a data standard for sharing biological designs and information about their implementation and characterization. Previously, this standard has only been used to represent designs in systems where the same design is implemented in every cell; however, there is also much interest in multicellular systems, in which designs involve a mixture of different types of cells with differing genotype and phenotype. Here, we show how the SBOL standard can be used to represent multicellular systems, and, hence, how researchers can better share designs with the community and reliably document intended system functionality.","tags":null,"title":"Capturing Multicellular System Designs Using Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pedro Fontanarrosa","Hamid Doosthosseini","Amin Espah Borujeni","Yuval Dorfan","Christopher A.

These glitches can have drastic effects if the output of the circuit causes irreversible changes within or with other cells such as a cascade of responses, apoptosis, or the release of a pharmaceutical in an off-target tissue. Therefore, avoiding unwanted variation of a circuit's output can be crucial for the safe operation of a genetic circuit. This paper investigates what causes unwanted switching variations in combinational genetic circuits using hazard analysis and a new dynamic model generator. The analysis is done in previously built and modeled genetic circuits with known glitching behavior. The dynamic models generated not only predict the same steady states as previous models but can also predict the unwanted switching variations that have been observed experimentally. Multiple input changes may cause glitches due to propagation delays within the circuit. Modifying the circuit's layout to alter these delays may change the likelihood of certain glitches, but it cannot eliminate the possibility that the glitch may occur. In other words, function hazards cannot be eliminated. Instead, they must be avoided by restricting the allowed input changes to the system. Logic hazards, on the other hand, can be avoided using hazard-free logic synthesis. This paper demonstrates this by showing how a circuit designed using a popular genetic design automation tool can be redesigned to eliminate logic hazards.","tags":null,"title":"Genetic Circuit Dynamics: Hazard and Glitch Analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Build-OptimizatiOn Software Tools (BOOST) is a platform of tools to design DNA sequences for manufacturing.

For example, specifying the variant codon TNT (where N is any nucleotide) will encode a mixture of the amino acids Tyr, Ser, Cys and Phe.\n         Contact Person Neil Swainston   Organization(s) Manchester Centre for Synthetic Biology of Fine and Specialty Chemicals (SYNBIOCHEM)   Programming Language Java   OS/Platform Web   Availability Open-Source    ","date":1593475200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1593475200,"objectID":"1b7f3e603cbe51cbf43d326d9da43e71","permalink":"/applications/genegenie/","publishdate":"2020-06-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/applications/genegenie/","section":"applications","summary":"GeneGenie supports the design and self-assembly of synthetic genes and constructs.","tags":["Sequence Design","SBOL1 Export"],"title":"GeneGenie","type":"applications"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"         Contact Person Hasan Baig   Organization(s) Denmark Technical University, Habib University, University of Connecticut   Programming Language Python, Java   OS/Platform MacOS, Windows   Availability Open-source, Free for all users    ","date":1593475200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1593475200,"objectID":"8cc59abab2689744ac388e9e4d5b1b16","permalink":"/applications/genetech/","publishdate":"2020-06-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/applications/genetech/","section":"applications","summary":"A tool which allows a user to generate genetic logic circuits only by specifying the logical function desired to be achieved in a living cell.","tags":["Circuit Design","SBOL2 Import","SBOL2 Export"],"title":"GeneTech","type":"applications"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"GenoCAD is a rule-based DNA design tool.

This document details version 2.2 of SBOL Visual, which builds on the prior SBOL Visual 2.1 in several ways. First, the grounding of molecular species glyphs is changed from BioPAX to SBO, aligning with the use of SBO terms for interaction glyphs. Second, new glyphs are added for proteins, introns, and polypeptide regions (e.~g., protein domains), the prior recommended macromolecule glyph is deprecated in favor of its alternative, and small polygons are introduced as alternative glyphs for simple chemicals.","tags":null,"title":"Synthetic Biology Open Language Visual (SBOL Visual) Version 2.2","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jeanet Mante","Zach Zundel","Chris Myers"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1588291200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1588291200,"objectID":"a9c55ee3c7a44c3e5cea91e3022bd044","permalink":"/publication/extending-syn-bio-hub-functionality-mante-2020/","publishdate":"2022-01-12T03:23:30.414215Z","relpermalink":"/publication/extending-syn-bio-hub-functionality-mante-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"SynBioHub is a repository for synthetic genetic designs represented in the Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL).

Despite several automated model construction approaches, computational methodologies to bridge knowledge in design repositories and the process of creating computational models have still not been established. This paper describes a workflow for automatic generation of computational models of genetic circuits from data stored in design repositories using existing standards. This workflow leverages the software tool SBOLDesigner to build structural models that are then enriched by the Virtual Parts Repository API using Systems Biology Open Language (SBOL) data fetched from the SynBioHub design repository. The iBioSim software tool is then utilized to convert this SBOL description into a computational model encoded using the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML). Finally, this SBML model can be simulated using a variety of methods. This workflow provides synthetic biologists with easy to use tools to create predictable biological systems, hiding away the complexity of building computational models. This approach can further be incorporated into other computational workflows for design automation.","tags":[],"title":"A Computational Workflow for the Automated Generation of Models of Genetic Designs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bryan A.

The Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL) has already emerged as a data standard to represent information about genetic circuits, and it is based on capturing data using graphs. The language provides the syntax using a free text document that is accessible to humans only. This paper describes SBOL-OWL, an ontology for a machine understandable definition of SBOL.

Computational modeling often requires expert knowledge and data to build models. Clearly, manual creation of models is not scalable for large designs. Despite several automated model construction approaches, computational methodologies to bridge knowledge in design repositories and the process of creating computational models have still not been established. This paper describes a workflow for automatic generation of computational models of genetic circuits from data stored in design repositories using existing standards. This workflow leverages the software tool SBOLDesigner to build structural models that are then enriched by the Virtual Parts Repository API using Systems Biology Open Language (SBOL) data fetched from the SynBioHub design repository. The iBioSim software tool is then utilized to convert this SBOL description into a computational model encoded using the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML). Finally, this SBML model can be simulated using a variety of methods. This workflow provides synthetic biologists with easy to use tools to create predictable biological systems, hiding away the complexity of building computational models. This approach can further be incorporated into other computational workflows for design automation.","tags":null,"title":"A Computational Workflow for the Automated Generation of Models of Genetic Designs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tramy Nguyen","Timothy S.

Here, we present a general and scalable platform entitled 'biomolecular implementation of protocellular communication' (BIO-PC) to engineer distributed multichannel molecular communication between populations of non-lipid semipermeable microcapsules. Our method leverages the modularity and scalability of enzyme-free DNA strand-displacement circuits to develop protocellular consortia that can sense, process and respond to DNA-based messages. We engineer a rich variety of biochemical communication devices capable of cascaded amplification, bidirectional communication and distributed computational operations. Encapsulating DNA strand-displacement circuits further allows their use in concentrated serum where non-compartmentalized DNA circuits cannot operate. BIO-PC enables reliable execution of distributed DNA-based molecular programs in biologically relevant environments and opens new directions in DNA computing and minimal cell technology.","tags":["*Cell Communication","Artificial Cells/*cytology/*metabolism","DNA/*metabolism","Logic","Signal Transduction","Synthetic Biology/*methods"],"title":"DNA-based Communication in Populations of Synthetic Protocells","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Includes means of succinctly representing sequence modifications, an extension to support organization and attachment of experimental data, and an extension for describing numerical parameters of design elements.

This program offers introductory biology and biotechnology classes to students of any age at a discounted rate.\n -- SoundBio, supported by the SBOL team, recently held a science outreach event to provide hands-on and engaging science activities and lessons to elementary school kids at Sacajawea Boys \u0026 Girls Club. As child care program, Sacajawea serves youth ages 5-12 in the Maple Leaf neighborhood. We thought this would be a great opportunity to bring science directly to children as well as partner with an amazing child care program. -- Because of the wide range of ages, we decided to split the students into 2 groups: grades 1-3 and grades 4-5. This allowed us to provide a more customized lesson based on the students’ scientific understanding and capabilities. With 8 SoundBio volunteers and 4 Sacajawea staff members, 39 students received lessons about camouflage, ears \u0026amp; soundwaves, microscopes, and DNA.\nDuring the Ears \u0026amp; Soundwaves lesson, 1-3 graders got to learn about different ear shapes found in nature and how soundwaves travel. During the activity students got to design their own ears! This resulted in some pretty spectacular designs.\nThe same students then learned about why animals hide and how it helps them. The students looked at pictures of different animals using camouflage in their natural environment. Then, using patterned paper as the background the kids cut out animal shapes and colored them to create camouflage!\nThe older students in grades 4-5 participated in the Microscope Exploration and DNA Extraction lessons.\n-- During the Microscope Exploration lesson, students learned about how microscopes help scientists see objects that are invisible to the naked eye. Students then used the microscope to look at the structures of common items like table salt and onion cells. Finally, each student was challenged to make their own slides using cardboard and tape. During the final lesson, students learned about traits, genes, and DNA. Students were asked to identify different inheritable traits like eye color, ear shape, and tongue rolling. We then connected these traits with genes and DNA. To support the lesson, students extracted DNA from strawberries using teamwork and measuring skills to create a DIY DNA extraction solution.\nThis was a fantastic event! The students and volunteers were engaged and had fun learning about science. Additionally, each student was given a handout to take home and continue the discussion of science with their parents and siblings in an effort to broaden this event to the larger community.\nFor more information about this program, buzz on over to SoundBioLab Membership at SoundBioLab.\n","date":1532323861,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1532323861,"objectID":"c862674aab4293a8d5647a9679eb8b73","permalink":"/event/2018/soundbiolab/","publishdate":"2018-07-23T05:31:01Z","relpermalink":"/event/2018/soundbiolab/","section":"event","summary":"Portions of this NSF Collaborative award supports science outreach classes at SoundBioLab, a non-profit, community-supported, Do-It-Yourself (DIY) biology laboratory located in Seattle, Washington.

To this end, we present a draft visual language, Protein Language, that describes the high-level architecture of an engineered protein with easy-to-draw glyphs, intended to be compatible with other biological diagram languages such as SBOL Visual and SBGN. Protein Language consists of glyphs for representing important features (e.g., globular domains, recognition and localization sequences, sites of covalent modification, cleavage and catalysis), rules for composing these glyphs to represent complex architectures, and rules constraining the scaling and styling of diagrams. To support Protein Language we have implemented an extensible web-based software diagram tool, Protein Designer, that uses Protein Language in a “drag and drop” interface for visualization and computer-aided-design of engineered proteins, as well as conversion of annotated protein sequences to Protein Language diagrams and figure export.

To this end, we present a draft visual language, Protein Language, that describes the high-level architecture of an engineered protein with easy-to-draw glyphs, intended to be compatible with other biological diagram languages such as SBOL Visual and SBGN. Protein Language consists of glyphs for representing important features (e.g., globular domains, recognition and localization sequences, sites of covalent modification, cleavage and catalysis), rules for composing these glyphs to represent complex architectures, and rules constraining the scaling and styling of diagrams. To support Protein Language we have implemented an extensible web-based software diagram tool, Protein Designer, that uses Protein Language in a ``drag and drop'' interface for visualization and computer-aided-design of engineered proteins, as well as conversion of annotated protein sequences to Protein Language diagrams and figure export. Protein Designer can be accessed at http://biocad.ncl.ac.uk/protein-designer/.","tags":null,"title":"A Visual Language for Protein Design","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michael Zhang","James Alastair McLaughlin","Anil Wipat","Chris J.

This paper describes SBOLDesigner 2, a genetic design automation (GDA) tool that natively supports both the SBOL data model (Version 2) and SBOL Visual (Version 1). This software is enabled to fetch and store parts and designs from SBOL repositories, such as SynBioHub. It can also import and export data about parts and designs in FASTA, GenBank, and SBOL 1 data format. Finally, it possesses a simple and intuitive user interface. This paper describes the design process using SBOLDesigner 2, highlighting new features over the earlier prototype versions.

To support automated, model-driven design it is desirable that in silico models are modular, composable and use standard formats. The synthetic biology design process typically involves the composition of genetic circuits from individual parts. At the most basic level, these parts are representations of genetic features such as promoters, ribosome binding sites (RBSs), and coding sequences (CDSs). However, it is also desirable to model the biological molecules and behaviour that arise when these parts are combined in vivo. Modular models of parts can be composed and their associated systems simulated, facilitating the process of model-centred design. The availability of databases of modular models is essential to support software tools used in the model-driven design process.

The goal of SBOL is to improve the reproducibility of these designs and their electronic exchange between researchers and/or genetic design automation tools. The latest version of the standard, SBOL 2.0, enables the annotation of a large variety of biological components (e.g., DNA, RNA, proteins, complexes, small molecules, etc.) and their interactions. SBOL 2.0 also allows researchers to organize components into hierarchical modules, to specify their intended functions, and to link modules to models that describe their behavior mathematically. To support the use of SBOL 2.0, we have developed the libSBOLj 2.0 Java library, which provides an easy to use Application Programming Interface (API) for developers, including manipulation of SBOL constructs, serialization to and from an RDF/XML file format, and migration support in the form of conversion from the prior SBOL 1.1 standard to SBOL 2.0. This letter describes the libSBOLj 2.0 library and key engineering decisions involved in its design.","tags":["\"Application programming interfaces\"","\"computational biology\"","\"Computational biology\"","\"Java\"","\"software libraries\"","\"Software libraries\"","\"software tools\"","\"Software tools\"","\"synthetic biology\"","\"Synthetic biology\""],"title":"libSBOLj 2.0: A Java Library to Support SBOL 2.0","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jacqueline Y.

Goal is to finish writing by SEED. Ontologies selected, when possible, for those needing them. Identifiers.org to provide the ontology terms. No significant changes to data model though some required fields changed to optional, especially those with no clear ontology. Other minor changes include: Interactions no longer require a participation, displayId was moved to Identified, roles removed from Model. Roles in other entities were made optional. Discussed the linking of ModuleDefinition entities to corresponding ComponentDefinitions   libSBOLj 2.0 Release  Agreed that beta release will support only compliant URIs.  TopLevel: /// 1st level child: //// NOTE: also decided  is optional.   Agreed that validation errors would be reported through exceptions. Agreed that beta release would have complete docs with simple examples. Tested libSBOLj in several applications:  Nicholas Roehner – SBOL to SBML converter. Tramy Nguyen – SBML to SBOL converter. Newcastle Group – VirtualParts Repository, SBOL Stack, and SynBad Bryan Der – Cello Neil Swanston – (Metabolic) SBML to SBOL converter. Integration with genome-scale models.   Beta release planned before SEED.   Publication Plan  Abstract on 2.0 submitted to IWBDA. Hope to submit to special ACS Synthetic Biology special issue. SBOLv paper is currently under review. libSBOLj paper under review at IEEE Life Science Letters libSBOLc paper under development.   Outreach Plan  Decided to make a new sbol-announce mailing list, make sbol-dev and sbol-visual public lists, and add old SBOL editors to sbol-editors list. Discussed several improvements to website such as making logos more prominent, better emphasis of international community and industrial supporters. We also need to keep the SBOL tools up to date. Talked about international advisory board for SBOL A SEED talk is scheduled to talk about SBOL, the community, and supporting tools   SBOLv and SBGN  Had dedicated session to interaction with SBGN. Got a better understanding of the SBGN capabilities. Conveyed our requirements to SBGN.

The design of biologically engineered systems is however nontrivial, requiring contributions from a wide array of disciplines. One particular issue that confronts synthetic biologists is the ability to unambiguously describe novel designs such that they can be reengineered by a third-party. For this reason, the synthetic biology open language (SBOL) was developed as a community wide standard for formally representing biological designs. A design created by one engineering team can be transmitted electronically to another who can then use this design to reproduce the experimental results. The development and the community of the SBOL standard started in 2008 and has since grown in use with now over 80 participants, including international, academic, and industrial interests.

The design of biologically engineered systems is however nontrivial, requiring contributions from a wide array of disciplines. One particular issue that confronts synthetic biologists is the ability to unambiguously describe novel designs such that they can be reengineered by a third-party. For this reason, the synthetic biology open language (SBOL) was developed as a community wide standard for formally representing biological designs. A design created by one engineering team can be transmitted electronically to another who can then use this design to reproduce the experimental results. The development and the community of the SBOL standard started in 2008 and has since grown in use with now over 80 participants, including international, academic, and industrial interests. SBOL has stimulated the development of repositories and software tools to help synthetic biologists in their design efforts. This chapter summarizes the latest developments and future of the SBOL standard and its supporting infrastructure.","tags":["Engineering design","SBOL 1","Standards","Synthetic biology"],"title":"The Synthetic Biology Open Language","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nicholas Roehner","Chris J.

The workflow is based on a sequence of intermediate models that incrementally translate high-level specifications into DNA samples that implement them. We identify algorithms for translating between adjacent models and implement them as a set of software tools, organized into a four-stage toolchain: Specification, Compilation, Part Assignment, and Assembly. The specification stage begins with a Boolean logic computation specified in the Proto programming language. The compilation stage uses a library of network motifs and cellular platforms, also specified in Proto, to transform the program into an optimized Abstract Genetic Regulatory Network (AGRN) that implements the programmed behavior. The part assignment stage assigns DNA parts to the AGRN, drawing the parts from a database for the target cellular platform, to create a DNA sequence implementing the AGRN. Finally, the assembly stage computes an optimized assembly plan to create the DNA sequence from available part samples, yielding a protocol for producing a sample of engineered plasmids with robotics assistance. Our workflow is the first to automate the production of biological networks from a high-level program specification. Furthermore, the workflow’s modular design allows the same program to be realized on different cellular platforms simply by swapping workflow configurations. We validated our workflow by specifying a small-molecule sensor-reporter program and verifying the resulting plasmids in both HEK 293 mammalian cells and in E. coli bacterial cells.","tags":[],"title":"An End-to-End Workflow for Engineering of Biological Networks from High-Level Specifications","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fusun Yaman","Swapnil Bhatia","Aaron Adler","Douglas Densmore","Jacob Beal"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1345161600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600547304,"objectID":"788ca7e6905405c1ed26bb9d25e2c1ce","permalink":"/publication/yaman-automated-2012/","publishdate":"2020-09-19T20:28:24.78168Z","relpermalink":"/publication/yaman-automated-2012/","section":"publication","summary":"Raising the level of abstraction for synthetic biology design requires solving several challenging problems, including mapping abstract designs to DNA sequences. In this paper we present the first formalism and algorithms to address this problem. The key steps of this transformation are feature matching, signal matching, and part matching.

The workflow is based on a sequence of intermediate models that incrementally translate high-level specifications into DNA samples that implement them. We identify algorithms for translating between adjacent models and implement them as a set of software tools, organized into a four-stage toolchain: Specification, Compilation, Part Assignment, and Assembly. The specification stage begins with a Boolean logic computation specified in the Proto programming language. The compilation stage uses a library of network motifs and cellular platforms, also specified in Proto, to transform the program into an optimized Abstract Genetic Regulatory Network (AGRN) that implements the programmed behavior. The part assignment stage assigns DNA parts to the AGRN, drawing the parts from a database for the target cellular platform, to create a DNA sequence implementing the AGRN. Finally, the assembly stage computes an optimized assembly plan to create the DNA sequence from available part samples, yielding a protocol for producing a sample of engineered plasmids with robotics assistance. Our workflow is the first to automate the production of biological networks from a high-level program specification. Furthermore, the workflow's modular design allows the same program to be realized on different cellular platforms simply by swapping workflow configurations. We validated our workflow by specifying a small-molecule sensor-reporter program and verifying the resulting plasmids in both HEK 293 mammalian cells and in E. coli bacterial cells.","tags":null,"title":"An End-to-End Workflow for Engineering of Biological Networks from High-Level Specifications","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fusun Yaman","Swapnil Bhatia","Aaron Adler","Douglas Densmore","Jacob Beal"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1343779200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1343779200,"objectID":"6a1b01cf55379f3057af03c3c4daf52a","permalink":"/publication/automated-selection-synthetic-yaman-2012/","publishdate":"2022-01-12T03:23:30.346278Z","relpermalink":"/publication/automated-selection-synthetic-yaman-2012/","section":"publication","summary":"Raising the level of abstraction for synthetic biology design requires solving several challenging problems, including mapping abstract designs to DNA sequences.

Use of standardized diagrams in engineering promotes fast and accurate communication between researchers, which in turn promotes effective re-use of biological parts.","tags":null,"title":"Standard for the Electronic Distribution of SBOLv Diagrams","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yuting Zheng","Ganesh Sriram"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1275177600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600547303,"objectID":"23280f19f57af150d279782d7cd14ece","permalink":"/publication/zheng-mathematical-2010/","publishdate":"2020-09-19T20:28:23.896399Z","relpermalink":"/publication/zheng-mathematical-2010/","section":"publication","summary":"Mathematical modeling plays an important and often indispensable role in synthetic biology because it serves as a crucial link between the concept and realization of a biological circuit.

Additionally we expound mathematical techniques used to analyze a model such as sensitivity analysis and bifurcation analysis, which enable the identification of the conditions that cause a synthetic circuit to behave in a desired manner. We also discuss the role of modeling in phenotype analysis such as metabolic and transcription network analysis and point out some available modeling standards and software.
